                    <h3>Colour Recognition and Distance Sensor</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            I joined FIRST ROBOTICS COMPETITON as part of two subteams in the 50 member robotics team.
                            As part of both the Design Team and Programming Team, I had a heavy software/hardware focus.
                            One of the ways to succeed in the upcoming competition was for the robot to turn a colour
                            wheel to match a pattern given to us. On the wheel, the robot had a combination of four
                            different colours that it had to sense and automatically rotate to the sequence. Another
                            obstacle that I worked on for this team was to determine how to robot would projectile a
                            ball into an eight foot goal. There were many factors to consider such as the angle of the
                            arm, velecity of the ball, and distance from the goal. My role in this project was to
                            install a sensor that would record the distance to the wall from the robot. Given the
                            distance, the robot would angle to the appropriate height to get the ball in the goal.
