                    <h3>Full-Stack Developer</h3>
                    <div>

                            During my role at Relay, I took on a diverse range of responsibilities aimed at enhancing the functionality, reliability, and security of their mobile and web apps. Focusing originally on small bug fixes, then moving on to enabling push notifications, spending control features, and improving continuous integration for new builds.
                            <br><br>
                            The term started with me learning React and React-Native, my first introduction to these software tools. I had a great manager to provide feedback so that way mistakes could quickly be learned from in pull request code reviews. The first feature that I worked on was a new modal to display transaction confirmation details before transferring money.
                            <br><br>
                            My next introduction was to GitHub actions and Fastlane. We used these tools to run GitHub workflows to create iOS/android builds and send them to Testflight, TestFairy, Google Play Store, and Sauce Labs. I learned how important it is to utilize continuous integration so that we are up to date with all recent changes. Catching those initial bugs before publishing versions ensured customer satisfaction
                            <br><br>
                            For 5 years, Relay had been planning to create push notifications for their mobile apps. This project was assigned to me where I leveraged Iterable's react-native SDK to manage notifications. Not only did this improve the user's experience, but is now a helpful feature to remind users of unpaid receipts. I had to work with updating the UI settings, creating new endpoints to save user preferences/permissions, and updating the existing user database tables.
                            <br><br>
                            Halfway through my term, I switched teams as another team had much demand for a massive update, credit cards. A vital new part of the app to become a one-stop-shop for banking needs. Myself and another full-time employee collaborated on establishing spending controls for Relay cards. We worked as full-stack developers to ensure that users could allow or block particular vendors/categories.
                            <br><br>
                            I took on a few smaller tasks such as creating feature flags, providing code reviews for co-workers, and updating the transaction data types to include new data. Overall this was a fantastic co-op experience where I benefited from useful feedback and a variety of challenging work. I will certainly miss working at this great up-and-coming company.
