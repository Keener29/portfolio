                    <h3>Swift in iOS and macOS</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The goals that I had during my employment at ZurApps Research was to learn and use iOS/macOS 
                            development skills. I taught myself the required technical skills after finding online resources 
                            and tutorials of the language Swift and application XCode. The first month at my co-op improved 
                            my abilities to find appropriate tools and understand the implementation of something new. My 
                            first responsibility was to update a pre-existing app's subscriptions. The old store had become 
                            outdated, so I began implementing Apple's StoreKit2 APIs. I had to use these APIs to see if the
                            the user was eligible for a free trial, had purchased a past product, and display any products
                            available to the user. This was the first time that ZurApps had introduced introductory offers
                            (free trials) and benefited their app by making the subscriptions more appealing.
                            <br><br>
                            The other project that was tasked to me was to create a new iOS app that enabled users to plan
                            road trips. This app's name is Road Tripper X, which is an improved and updated app that came
                            their old and problematic app Road Tripper (which has since then had bug fixes from my work). 
                            The new and important feature of this new app was that it was connected to a macOS version, hence
                            making it multiplatform. This pros of having a multiplatform app was that the user's purchases 
                            would be shared between both their iOS and macOS apps. I completed Road Tripper X which is now
                            available on the Apple App Store and a new source of income for the company.
